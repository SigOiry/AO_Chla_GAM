Three key environmental drivers—sea-surface temperature (SST), ice cover (IceCover) and wind speed (WindSpeed)—were each entered as thin-plate regression splines whose shape was allowed to vary by Region, thus capturing potentially different non‐linear responses across regions. Weakly regularizing priors were placed on the intercept (Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)), on each spline’s smoothing standard deviation (half-Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)), and on the Gamma shape parameter φ (Gamma(0.01, 0.01)).\nPosterior inference was carried out via the NUTS Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler in brms (Bürkner 2017, 2018, 2021) with 4 chains, each run for 5 000 iterations (500 warm-up, 4500 post-warm-up). Convergence and sampling quality were assessed by inspecting the Gelman–Rubin statistic (all R̂ ≤ 1.01) and bulk and tail effective sample sizes (all &gt; 1 000), confirming thorough exploration of the joint posterior.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Chla}_i \\;\\bigl|\\;\\mu_i,\\phi\\bigr.\n&\\sim \\operatorname{Gamma}\\bigl(\\,\\mathrm{shape} = \\phi,\\;\\mathrm{rate} = \\tfrac{\\phi}{\\mu_i}\\bigr), \\\\[4pt]\n\nE[\\mathrm{Chla}_i] = \\mu_i, \\\\[6pt]\n\n\\log(\\mu_i) &= \\eta_i, \\\\[4pt]\n\n\\eta_i\n&= \\alpha\n   + f_1\\bigl(\\mathrm{SST}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_2\\bigl(\\mathrm{IceCover}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_3\\bigl(\\mathrm{WindSpeed}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr),\n   \\\\[8pt]\n\nf_j(x \\mid r)\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{K_j} \\beta_{jkr}\\,B_{jk}(x),\n\\quad j = 1,2,3,\\; r = 1,\\dots,R, \\\\[10pt]\n\n\\alpha &\\sim t_{3}(0,\\,2.5), \\\\[2pt]\n\\beta_{jkr} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}\\bigl(0,\\sigma_j^{2}\\bigr), \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma_j &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,\\,2.5),\n\\quad j = 1,2,3, \\\\[2pt]\n\\phi    &\\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(0.01,\\,0.01).\n\\end{aligned}\\]"
