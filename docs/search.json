To improve convergence and account for differing scales, both the response and all five environmental drivers (SST, IceCover, Mean_WindSpeed_Above10, Freq_WindSpeed_Above10, WindSpeed) were standardized (z-scored) prior to modelling. The standardized response was then modelled with a Student’s t likelihood for robustness to outliers, and each predictor entered as a thin-plate spline with region-specific smooths. Basic weakly-informative priors were used throughout.\nPosterior inference used NUTS with 4 chains of 5 000 iterations (500 warm-up). All Rhat ≤1.01 and effective sample sizes &gt; 1 000, indicating good convergence.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= z(\\mathrm{Chla}_i),\n\\quad\nx_{ji} = z(\\mathrm{Covariate}_{j,i}),\\; j=1,\\dots,5, \\\\[6pt]\ny_i \\mid \\mu_i,\\sigma,\\nu\n&\\sim t_\\nu(\\mu_i,\\sigma), \\\\[6pt]\n\\mu_i &= \\eta_i, \\\\[4pt]\n\\eta_i\n&= \\alpha\n   + f_1\\bigl(\\mathrm{SST}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_2\\bigl(\\mathrm{IceCover}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr) \\\\[-2pt]\n&\\quad\n   + f_3\\bigl(\\mathrm{Mean\\_WindSpeed\\_Above10}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_4\\bigl(\\mathrm{Freq\\_WindSpeed\\_Above10}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr) \\\\[-2pt]\n&\\quad\n   + f_5\\bigl(\\mathrm{WindSpeed}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr),\n\\\\[8pt]\nf_j(x\\mid r)\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{K_j}\\beta_{jkr}\\,B_{jk}(x),\n\\quad r=1,\\dots,R,\\; j=1,\\dots,5,\n\\\\[8pt]\n\\alpha &\\sim t_{3}(0,2.5), \\\\[2pt]\n\\beta_{jkr} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_j^{2}), \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma_j &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,2.5),\\; j=1,\\dots,5, \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,2.5), \\\\[2pt]\n\\nu &\\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(2,0.1).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"
