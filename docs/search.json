To improve model convergence and account for heavy-tailed residuals, chlorophyll-a values were first log-transformed and then standardized (z-scored) prior to modelling. The standardized log-transformed Chla was modelled using a Student’s t-distribution, which allows for heavier tails and increased robustness to outliers compared to the Gaussian.\nThree key environmental drivers—sea-surface temperature (SST), ice cover (IceCover), and wind speed (WindSpeed)—were included as thin-plate regression splines with region-specific smooths to capture potentially different non-linear responses across regions. Weakly regularizing priors were placed on the intercept (Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)), on each spline’s smoothing standard deviation (half-Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)), and on the residual standard deviation (half-Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)).\nPosterior inference was performed using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method implemented in brms, with 4 chains of 5,000 iterations each (500 warm-up, 4,500 post-warm-up). Convergence diagnostics indicated satisfactory sampling, with all Gelman–Rubin statistics (R̂) ≤ 1.01 and all bulk and tail effective sample sizes &gt; 1,000, confirming a thorough exploration of the joint posterior.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nz\\bigl(\\log(\\mathrm{Chla}_i)\\bigr) \\;\\bigl|\\; \\mu_i, \\sigma, \\nu\n&\\sim t_\\nu(\\mu_i,\\,\\sigma), \\\\[6pt]\n\nE\\bigl[z(\\log(\\mathrm{Chla}_i))\\bigr] &= \\mu_i, \\\\[6pt]\n\n\\mu_i &= \\eta_i, \\\\[4pt]\n\n\\eta_i\n&= \\alpha\n   + f_1\\bigl(\\mathrm{SST}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_2\\bigl(\\mathrm{IceCover}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr)\n   + f_3\\bigl(\\mathrm{WindSpeed}_i \\mid \\mathrm{Region}_i\\bigr),\n   \\\\[8pt]\n\nf_j(x \\mid r)\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{K_j} \\beta_{jkr}\\,B_{jk}(x),\n\\quad j = 1,2,3,\\; r = 1,\\dots,R, \\\\[10pt]\n\n\\alpha &\\sim t_{3}(0,\\,2.5), \\\\[2pt]\n\\beta_{jkr} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma_j^{2}), \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma_j &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,\\,2.5),\n\\quad j = 1,2,3, \\\\[2pt]\n\\sigma &\\sim t^{+}_{3}(0,\\,2.5), \\\\[2pt]\n\\nu &\\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\\,0.1).\n\\end{aligned}\\]"
